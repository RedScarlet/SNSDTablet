SNSDTablet
==========

The assignment is to convert this app into a tablet friend app.
At the moment it scales up fine, and since it's just text, it is pretty acceptable.
But that's not what we want.

Do what ever you want to it, even make it an actual app or something.
But show that you can design a tablet layout that not only looks good, but functions just as well.

These should point you in the right direction, I recommend you at least skim over them.
It might also be wise to get some sort of grasp on fragment, since that's what the app is made up of (This app and the SSF app).

There is no due date, but just don't abandon this or take forever.

Tada, finally got this thing to even function properly. Shall start getting work done from this point on. MY FIRST COMMIT! <3

Managed to fix the orientation change problem which causes the app to crash. Took a VERY long time to find for the solution but now it's resolved. Now that the app is basically 'bugless', i'll begin to play around with the fragments next. (Finally)

Still doing heavy research on different fragment layouts. In the meantime, enabled screen compatibility mode if it makes any sense, haha.

Tried finishing the standard layouts today. Didn't turn out as planned, but I know i'm almost there.
